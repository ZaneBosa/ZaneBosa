My diverse background covers software development, project management, and accounting, equipping me with a clear project oversight, essential analytical skills, and a deep understanding of business processes.

I am a self-motivated professional with meticulous attention to detail and analytical thinking. Described as diligent, tolerant, and hard-working, I am known for my high level of responsibility and a good sense of humor. My versatile personality makes me a valuable team member, and I am equally adept at working efficiently on my own to achieve set goals.

I see similarities between my passion for coding and my hobby. Sailing isn't about luxury yachts, millionaires, and glamourâ€”I'm breaking stereotypes here. Instead:

It takes a desire to try, learn, and train.
Adaptation to different and tough conditions is essential.
Self-discipline is crucial for achieving higher accuracy in team performance.
Knowledge transfer is integral.
Setting new goals and pursuing them while enjoying the process.
